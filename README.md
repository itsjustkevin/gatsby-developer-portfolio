### Hi everyone!

Welcome to my developer portfolio site where you can learn a little about me and what I do.  As a brief introduction, I'm Kevin, a software engineer working as a Radar Systems Engineer in the Navy.  I spend most of my time outside of work doing web development.

My favorite programming language is Ruby, I would use it for everything if I could and I'm not ashamed of it üòè! Some of the languages I work with include: Ruby, JavaScript, Java and PHP.  I consider myself a full-stack developer, -- Why you ask? -- because thats the quickest way to make my ideas come to life. 

The tools I use to make my development more joyful are: Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Node, Vue and React.  If you were to ask me to choose between Vue and React... Sorry React, you gotta go (Though this portfolio is lovingly built with Gatsby).  

Thank you for taking the time to hear a little about me.

- Kevin
