## The Skeleton is Alive!

The skeleton for my portfolio site is complete. The goal from this point is to incrementally update my portfolio site and document the process from beginning to end, while keeping a running tab of the features added and design decisions. The process will be documented through the use of the blog.

The documentation of the process is to open a window for others to take a look at my design and decision making process. Through this process, I also hope to improve my general communication ability by continuously flexing my writing skills.

I hope you enjoy the journey through my mind!
