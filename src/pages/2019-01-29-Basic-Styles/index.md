## Global Styling

Now that the site is up, I need to get rid of some of the things that bother me. The first things that come to my attention are:

- Font
- Link styling
- Margins and Padding

### Font

I needed a font that is nice to look at but not hard to read on any screen size. I chose the googlefont "Lato" as it is something nice for now and a great placeholder.

### Link Styling

The big purple links were not doing it for me, so I got rid of the global link styling to later customize it for my own purposes later.

### Margins and Padding

Everything was pressed against both sides of the screen making the text extremely difficult to follow and gave no sense of focus. To give it a little breathing room, I added some padding for the body.
